Page 1: Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Classification
   - Regression
   
2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality reduction
   
3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Agent-based learning
   - Reward optimization

Page 2: Deep Learning

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.

Popular Deep Learning Architectures:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data
- Transformers for natural language processing
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generation tasks

Page 3: Vector Embeddings

Vector embeddings represent text, images, or other data as numerical vectors in high-dimensional space. Similar items have similar vector representations.

Applications of Embeddings:

- Semantic search
- Document similarity
- Recommendation systems
- Clustering and classification

The quality of embeddings is crucial for RAG systems because they determine how well relevant information can be retrieved.
