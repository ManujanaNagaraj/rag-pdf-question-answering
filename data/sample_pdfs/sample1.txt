Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

Key Concepts in NLP:

1. Tokenization: Breaking text into smaller units called tokens
2. Named Entity Recognition: Identifying entities like names, locations, organizations
3. Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone of text
4. Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another
5. Question Answering: Building systems that can answer questions about text

Applications of NLP:

- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Search engines and information retrieval
- Text summarization and generation
- Language translation services
- Voice recognition systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It helps reduce hallucinations in language models by grounding responses in retrieved factual information from a knowledge base.

The RAG pipeline consists of:
1. Document ingestion and chunking
2. Embedding generation
3. Vector storage and indexing
4. Query processing and retrieval
5. Context-aware answer generation

This approach is particularly useful for building question-answering systems that need to provide accurate, factual responses based on specific documents or knowledge bases.
